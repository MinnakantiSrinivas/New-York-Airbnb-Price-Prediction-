**Overview**

This project focuses on predicting the price of Airbnb listings in New York City using a curated dataset with relevant features such as neighborhood, property type, room type, accommodation capacity, number of bathrooms, and number of beds. The goal is to provide a transparent and efficient price prediction model alongside an interactive R Shiny dashboard for visualization and analysis.

**Key Highlights**

**Dataset Preparation:**

Utilized an Airbnb dataset with key features impacting price.

Transformed price data from character to numeric format.

Applied encoding techniques to convert categorical variables into a machine-learning-friendly format.

**Model Development:**
Constructed a linear regression model due to its interpretability and effectiveness for this problem.
Splitted the data into training and test sets to validate the model's performance on unseen data.

**Interactive Dashboard:**
Built an R Shiny dashboard for users to explore predicted prices across the five boroughs of New York City:
